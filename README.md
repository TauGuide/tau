# Tau Chain explained
This is an attempt to describe and explain [Tau Chain](https://github.com/IDNI/) for the masses. Eventually this resource assists the communication about Tau Chain or the writing of the very coveted scientific Tau whitepaper.
## Status
This is an ongoing endeavor. The current status is collecting and reading up on existing resources found on [bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=950309.0), in the Tau Chain [IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##idni), on [telegram](https://t.me/tauchain), [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tauchain/), [steemit](https://steemit.com/created/tauchain), blogs, scientific papers and elsewhere online.

# Sections
This repository consists of three sections. Existing resources about Tau Chain are listed in the [sources](Sources.md) section, after inspection, content is integrated in the [content](Content.md) section and archived in the [archive](Archive.md).

Each section has it's own file:
* [Content.md](Content.md) **<- start reading here**
* [Sources.md](Sources.md)
* [Archive.md](Archive.md)

# For collaborators
Read the first 3 official blogs on idni.org (in reverse order, see [sources](Sources.md) section) and explain Tau in the [content](Content.md) of this document in such a way every (educated) person can understand and validate the information, without deep understanding of mathematics, computer science, compiler design, etc. In the future in-depth (technical) knowledge could be added.
## 3 step collaboration process
**1) Add URL's to resources** in the relevant category (or in the unsorted category) under [sources](Sources.md) section, preferably with a comment about it's content. After reading, **2a) Remove and archive** irrelevant content (move URL from Sources.md to the [archive](Archive.md) section, with a comment why), or, if the information is (still) relevant,  **2b) Describe or explain** the topic in a comprehensible manner in [content](Content.md). If the resource contains additional useful content afterwards, please **3a) add a comment** alongside the URL in the sources section mentioning the used/unused parts. **3b) Remove and archive** the URL - again preferably with a comment - once all *relevant* content from the resource is documented here *and* properly attributed.
