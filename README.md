# Tau Chain explained
This document is the result of a little documentation project in an attempt to describe and explain [Tau Chain](https://github.com/IDNI/) for the masses. Eventually this resource assists the communication about Tau Chain or the writing of the very coveted scientific whitepaper of Tau.
# Method
## Approach
Read the first 3 official blogs on idni.org (in reverse order, see [sources](Sources.md) below) and explain Tau in the [content](Content.md) of this document in such a way every (educated) person can understand and validate the information without deep understanding of mathematics, computer science, compiler design, etc. In the future in-depth knowledge could be added.
## Status
This is a ongoing endeavor. Current status is collecting and reading up on existing resources found on [bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=950309.0), in the Tau Chain [IRC chat](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##idni), on [telegram](https://t.me/tauchain), blogs, steemit and elsewhere online. Found resources are listed in this file under [sources](Sources.md) and, after inspection, archived in the [archive](Archive.md) or integrated with the [content](Content.md) section.
## 3 step collaboration process
**1) Add URL's to resources** in the relevant category (or in the unsorted category) under [sources](Sources.md) section, preferably with a comment about it's content. After reading, **2a) Remove and archive** irrelevant content (move URL from Sources.md to the [archive](Archive.md) section, with a comment why), or, if the information is (still) relevant,  **2b) Describe or explain** the topic in a comprehensible manner in [content](Content.md). If the resource contains additional useful content afterwards, please **3a) add a comment** alongside the URL in the sources section mentioning the used/unused parts. **3b) Remove and archive** the URL - again preferably with a comment - once all *relevant* content from the resource is documented here *and* properly attributed.
